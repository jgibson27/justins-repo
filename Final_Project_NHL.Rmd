This plot shows the importance of this research question. It is evident that NHL hockey players' salaries vary greatly amongst NHL players and there is a lot more research we can do to understand why a hockey player is being paid a given salary.

```{r introduction 1}
# Log transformation of Salaries
NHL.df$Salary = log(NHL.df$Salary)

sal.intro.plot.log = ggplot(NHL.df, aes(x=player.num.vec, y=NHL.df$Salary)) + geom_point()

```{r linear regression}
# Linear regression on all the data to see if any variables can explain all players
set.seed(1)
lin.reg = lm(NHL.df$Salary ~ Age + Contract.Length + t_on_ice + assists + goals + pim + shots + games + hits + pp_goals + pp_points + pp_t_on_ice + even_t_on_ice + pen_min + face_off_perc + shot_perc + game_win_goals + over_t_goals + short_hand_goals + short_hand_points + short_hand_t_on_ice + blocked + plus_minus + points + shifts, data = NHL.df)

summary(lin.reg)

```

Omitted logistic variables, but kept all numeric variables. This provided very interesting results, we now have a better understanding of what variables have explanatory power for the independent variable, salary. The variables: Age, contract.length, assists, games, and face_off_perc all have explanatory power. Further linear regression will be completed below to determine what variables have the most explanatory power by removing variables that have little explanatory power.

One variable was removed if two variables have strong a correlation, i.e (shots & shot_perc, t_on_ice & shifts). Other variables were removed as well that had high p-values.

```{r lin reg explanatory power}
#Removed variables, hoping to find variables with more explanatory power
lin.reg1 = lm(NHL.df$Salary ~ Age + Contract.Length + assists + goals + pp_points + shots + games + face_off_perc + short_hand_points + plus_minus + shifts + pp_t_on_ice, data = NHL.df)

summary(lin.reg1)
```

Shots, face_off_perc, and plus_minus are removed as they all are not significant

```{r}
# More variables were taken out, notice the increased r^2 below
lin.reg2 = lm(NHL.df$Salary ~ Age + Contract.Length + assists + goals + games + short_hand_points + shifts + pp_t_on_ice, data = NHL.df)

summary(lin.reg2)
```

Not surprisingly contract length is correlated with Salaries. It is understandable that NHL teams want to sign players for long contracts if they are going to invest in them and their performance.

By preforming a boost regression on the entire NHL data frame, it is evident that Contract Length has the most explanatory power with respect to Salary. The runner up is pp_t_on_ice which is power play time on ice. This is a surprising result. This tells a different story then the simple linear regression preformed above where power play time on ice was less significant then many other variables.
